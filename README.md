# Learn Bazel 🚀

Welcome to your comprehensive Bazel learning repository! This collection contains everything a software developer should know about Bazel - from its history and technical foundations to practical examples and best practices.

## � Reproducible Development Environment

This repository includes a **devcontainer** configuration for consistent, reproducible development across different machines and teams. The container includes:

- Bazel (latest stable version)
- C/C++ toolchain (GCC, Clang)
- Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo)
- Python (for code generation)
- VS Code extensions for Bazel development

## 📚 What You'll Learn

This repository focuses on systems programming languages and includes:

- **History & Context**: Understanding where Bazel came from and why it exists
- **Technical Foundation**: The tech stack, architecture, and dependencies
- **Core Concepts**: Essential knowledge for working with Bazel
- **Practical Examples**: Hands-on projects with **C, C++, and Rust**
- **Code Generation**: Using Python/Jinja2 for build-time code generation
- **Resources**: Curated links and references for deeper learning

## 🗺️ Learning Path

### 1. Foundation Knowledge
- [📖 History of Bazel](./docs/01-history.md) - Origins, evolution, and timeline
- [⚙️ Tech Stack & Architecture](./docs/02-tech-stack.md) - Languages, dependencies, and technical details
- [🎯 Core Concepts](./docs/03-core-concepts.md) - Build files, workspaces, targets, and rules

### 2. Development Setup
- [🐳 Devcontainer Setup](./.devcontainer/) - Reproducible development environment
- [🔧 VS Code Configuration](./.vscode/) - Extensions and workspace settings

### 3. Hands-On Learning
- [💡 Basic Examples](./examples/basic/) - Simple C/C++/Rust projects
- [🦀 Rust Integration](./examples/rust/) - Rust-specific Bazel patterns
- [⚙️ Code Generation](./examples/codegen/) - Python/Jinja2 code generation
- [📦 Advanced Patterns](./examples/advanced/) - Complex build scenarios

### 4. Reference Materials
- [📚 Resources & Links](./docs/04-resources.md) - Official docs, tutorials, and community resources
- [❓ FAQ](./docs/05-faq.md) - Common questions and troubleshooting
- [📝 Glossary](./docs/06-glossary.md) - Bazel terminology explained

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Using Devcontainer (Recommended)
1. **Open in VS Code**: Clone this repo and open in VS Code
2. **Reopen in Container**: Use "Reopen in Container" when prompted
3. **Start Learning**: Everything is pre-configured!

### Option 2: Local Setup
1. **Install Bazel**: Follow instructions at [bazel.build](https://bazel.build)
2. **Install Toolchains**: C/C++ (GCC/Clang), Rust, Python
3. **Start with Basics**: Navigate to `examples/basic/`

### Learning Path
If you're completely new to Bazel:

1. Start with the [History of Bazel](./docs/01-history.md) to understand the context
2. Learn about the [Tech Stack](./docs/02-tech-stack.md) to understand what you're working with
3. Dive into [Core Concepts](./docs/03-core-concepts.md) for the fundamentals
4. Try the [Basic Examples](./examples/basic/) to get hands-on experience

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of build systems and compilation
- Familiarity with command-line tools
- Experience with **C, C++, or Rust** programming
- **VS Code** and **Docker** (for devcontainer setup)
- Basic **Git** knowledge
