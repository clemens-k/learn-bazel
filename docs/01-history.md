# History of Bazel

## üìú Origins and Background

### The Google Problem

Bazel's story begins with Google's massive codebase challenges in the early 2000s. Google's monolithic repository (monorepo) contained millions of lines of code across multiple programming languages, and traditional build systems simply couldn't handle the scale and complexity.

### Birth of Blaze (2003-2006)

Google engineers developed **Blaze**, an internal build system designed to solve these specific challenges:

- **Massive Scale**: Handle millions of lines of code and thousands of developers
- **Incremental Builds**: Only rebuild what changed to minimize build times
- **Reproducible Builds**: Ensure consistent results across different machines and environments
- **Multi-Language Support**: Support Java, C++, Python, and other languages in a single system
- **Distributed Building**: Leverage Google's distributed infrastructure for faster builds

Key innovations of Blaze:

- **Hermetic builds**: Each build is isolated with explicit dependencies
- **Build graph**: Represents dependencies as a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
- **Remote caching**: Share build artifacts across the entire organization
- **Fine-grained parallelism**: Execute independent build actions in parallel

## üåç Open Source Evolution

### The Decision to Open Source (2014-2015)

By 2014, Google recognized that many organizations faced similar build challenges. The decision to open-source Blaze was driven by:

1. **Community Benefit**: Share Google's build expertise with the broader development community
2. **External Validation**: Get feedback and contributions from diverse use cases
3. **Standardization**: Create industry standards for large-scale build systems
4. **Recruitment**: Attract talent familiar with Google's development practices

### Bazel is Born (March 2015)

- **March 26, 2015**: Google announced Bazel as the open-source version of Blaze
- **Name Origin**: "Bazel" is an anagram of "Blaze" (with some letters rearranged)
- **Initial Release**: Beta version supporting Java and C++ builds
